# Getting provided CSV files

This dataset is used by the paper. To get the dataset, you need to get permission from the original author.

After getting permission from the original author, you forward the corresponding email to Tom (me@tomshen.io) and Tom will send you the link to download. Once you get the file, put it here and run:

```bash
sha1sum -c *.sha1
```

Then, unzip the file and preprocess it.
